I. Design an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). (Score 5).

- Create a User class with attributes name, age, address, phoneNumber and bankAccountNumber.

- Create a Atm class with attributes availableAmountInMachine, transactionFee and userData.

- userData should store USER, PASSWORD, and other account details internally in a dataStructure of your choice.

- The constructor should initialize all the attributes.

- The machine should be able to perform these actions.

- Ask for NEW USER or CURRENT USER as the start.

- Create a NEW USER with a unique bankAccountNumber and password.

- CURRENT USER should be able to login using bankAccountNumber and password.

- CURRENT USER should be able to use FORGOT PASSWORD.

- PASSWORD can be resetted by validating the name, age and phoneNumber of the user.

- After login the user should be able to use availableBalance, withDrawal, deposit, recentTransactions, changePassword and exit.

- recentTransaction should display the last 10 transactions, in a format of transactionName - amount. (transactionName is withDrawal or deposit).

- Add a transactionFee for every transaction done and update the availableAmountInMachine.

- Machine should not allow user to withdrawal more amount than his availableBalance.

- You can add additional functions to make it pretty. UI is not required.
