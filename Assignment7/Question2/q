Write a program that decode a file. Given an encoded file, create its decoded file. The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
q
Assume that the string from input file is always valid; No extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k. For example, there won't be input like 3a or 2[4].

Examples:
Input file: "3[a]2[bc]", output file: "aaabcbc".
Input file: "3[a2[c]]", output file: "accaccacc".
Input file: "2[abc]3[cd]ef", output file: "abcabccdcdcdef".
